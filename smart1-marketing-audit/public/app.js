    When ${vendorCount || 'several'} vendors each run part of the marketing, each one reports on its own slice and each slice
    looks acceptable in isolation. Nobody can answer the only question that matters: which dollar produced which customer.</p>
    <ul class="facts">
      <li><b>Attribution breaks at the seams.</b> A visitor who sees a social ad, searches the brand two days later, and calls
      from the map listing gets counted by whichever vendor claims the last click. Two vendors bill for the same customer, and
      the channel that actually created the demand looks like the weakest performer.</li>
      <li><b>Budget moves in the wrong direction.</b> Without a single view, spend shifts toward whichever vendor reports most
      confidently rather than whichever produces revenue. That is how the cheapest-looking channel quietly gets defunded.</li>
      <li><b>Duplicate spend goes unnoticed.</b> Overlapping retargeting, brand-term bidding against the client's own organic
      listing, and two vendors buying the same audience are only visible when someone can see every account at once.
      ${est ? `In a program at ${usd(m.spend)} a month, ten percent overlap is ${usd(est)} a month, or ${usd(est * 12)} a year.` : ''}</li>
      <li><b>Testing becomes impossible.</b> Meaningful optimization needs one variable changed at a time against one measure of
      success. Separate vendors optimizing separate metrics on separate schedules cancel each other's results out.</li>
      <li><b>Nobody owns the outcome.</b> When leads fall, each vendor can point to its own numbers and be right. Consolidation
      creates one accountable party for cost per acquired customer, not per click.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="ind-note">Consolidation does not have to mean one vendor for everything. It means one place where all spend, leads,
    and closed sales are visible together, and one party accountable for that view.
    ${tracked ? 'That work has to start with conversion tracking — until that exists, consolidating vendors just centralizes the same blind spot.' : ''}</p>`;
